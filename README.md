# Pi Coding Agent — bramburn fork

Fork of [earendil-works/pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) maintained by
[Kaps Ramburn](https://github.com/bramburn) (`nitrogen@gmail.com`).

Tracks upstream `main` and re-applies the fork markers after each sync.

## Differences from upstream

- `pi --version` prints `pi <version> [bramburn]` (fork marker, see
  `packages/coding-agent/src/config.ts` `FORK_NAME`).
- Per-package `.npmrc` files in every workspace package, prepared for
  `@bramburn` npm-scope publishing on tag push.
- Three fork-specific fixes preserved across upstream merges:
  - **Per-sibling `toolResult` emission** in parallel tool batches (no orphans
    when one sibling stalls). `packages/agent/src/agent-loop.ts`.
  - **Scrollback-jump guard** while streaming with the viewport scrolled up.
    `packages/tui/src/tui-main-screen.ts`.
  - **Reverted Z.AI model test references** to currently available models
    (Z.AI is not in the fork's provider list).
- Workspace / lockfile restore: packages use upstream's `@earendil-works/*`
  npm scope for workspace resolution. The earlier `@bramburn` rename was
  reverted because the renamed packages are not yet on npm.

## All packages

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **[@earendil-works/pi-ai](packages/ai)** | Unified multi-provider LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) |
| **[@earendil-works/pi-agent-core](packages/agent)** | Agent runtime with tool calling and state management |
| **[@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent](packages/coding-agent)** | Interactive coding agent CLI |
| **[@earendil-works/pi-tui](packages/tui)** | Terminal UI library with differential rendering |

## Permissions & Containerization

Pi does not include a built-in permission system for restricting filesystem, process, network, or credential access. By default, it runs with the permissions of the user and process that launched it.

If you need stronger boundaries, containerize or sandbox Pi. See [packages/coding-agent/docs/containerization.md](packages/coding-agent/docs/containerization.md) for three patterns:

- **Gondolin extension**: keep `pi` and provider auth on the host while routing built-in tools and `!` commands into a local Linux micro-VM.
- **Plain Docker**: run the whole `pi` process in a local container for simple isolation.
- **OpenShell**: run the whole `pi` process in a policy-controlled sandbox.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for project-specific rules (for both humans and agents).

## Development

```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts  # Install all dependencies without running lifecycle scripts
npm run build         # Refresh model data, then build all packages
npm run build:offline # Rebuild using existing model data without network access
npm run check         # Lint, format, and type check
./test.sh             # Run tests (skips LLM-dependent tests without API keys)
./pi-test.sh          # Run pi from sources (can be run from any directory)
```

## Building standalone binaries from release source

GitHub releases include a versioned source archive covered by the release's `SHA256SUMS` file. Extract it and run the same build script used for the official standalone binaries:

```bash
VERSION="<release-version>"
tar -xzf "pi-${VERSION}-source.tar.gz"
cd "pi-${VERSION}"
./scripts/build-binaries.sh --offline-model-data --platform linux-x64 --out "$PWD/out"
```

The source archive includes the generated provider model data used for the release. `--offline-model-data` builds with that snapshot instead of refreshing it from live provider catalogs. The script still installs dependencies, builds the monorepo, compiles the Bun executable, and stages its runtime assets. Package maintainers who provide dependencies separately can pass `--skip-install --skip-deps`.

## Supply-chain hardening

We treat npm dependency changes as reviewed code changes.

- Direct external dependencies are pinned to exact versions. Internal workspace packages remain version-ranged.
- `.npmrc` sets `save-exact=true` and `min-release-age=2` to avoid same-day dependency releases during npm resolution.
- `package-lock.json` is the dependency ground truth. Pre-commit blocks accidental lockfile commits unless `PI_ALLOW_LOCKFILE_CHANGE=1` is set.
- `npm run check` verifies pinned direct deps, native TypeScript import compatibility, and the generated coding-agent shrinkwrap.
- The published CLI package includes `packages/coding-agent/npm-shrinkwrap.json`, generated from the root lockfile, to pin transitive deps for npm users.
- Release smoke tests use `npm run release:local` to build, pack, and create isolated npm and Bun installs outside the repo before tagging a release.
- Local release installs, documented npm installs, and `pi update --self` use `--ignore-scripts` where supported.
- CI installs with `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, and a scheduled GitHub workflow runs `npm audit --omit=dev` plus `npm audit signatures --omit=dev`.
- Shrinkwrap generation has an explicit allowlist for dependency lifecycle scripts; new lifecycle-script deps fail checks until reviewed.
